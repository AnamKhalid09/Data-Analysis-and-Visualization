## Background

_"According to an IBM report, data science jobs will show a growth of 30%. As per the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 11 million jobs would be created by the year 2026. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics further predicts a stupendous growth in the data science field between now and 2029, with professionals being paid quite well. According to a websource, Data scientist is ranked #3 in best technology jobs on the global charts!"(See References)_

Now the question is, Do we have data that supports this narration? If yes, how is the field doing in Australia? Are data scientists being paid well in Australia? What job titles are at the top in terms of salary? How about the distribution of opportunities among different states? Does being in Metro or Regional affects the job opportunities? What skills are the pre-requisites? 

### Before You Begin

1. Create a new repository for this project and name it as **project-one**. 
   **Do not add this to an existing repository**.

2. Clone the new repository to your computer.

3. Inside your local Git repository, create a directory. Use a folder name such as: **Data-Science**.

4. Inside the folder you just created, add new file called `data_science.ipynb`. These will be the main script to run for each analysis.

5. Create another folder called **Resources** and put your csv file in it.

6. Add a .gitignore file as a good practice in case you want to keep any confidential files in it like your API keys. .gitignore file will keep all the files hidden from being published publicly even if your repository is public. For API keys, open your .gitignore file and in the first line type the following:

```python
# Adding config.py file.
api_keys.py
```

7 .Add a README.md file to share your approach towards project.

8. Push the above changes to GitHub.

## Data-Science

In this folder, you'll create a Python script to visualise some of the facts about data science job opportunities, best companies, popular job locations, employee satisfaction and required skillset.

Follow the steps below to unveil the facts:

- Import libraries
- Read the csv file and display the data in the form of a dataframe.
- Analyze the dataframe by looking at the number of rows and columns and roll your sleeves up to start cleanup.
- Identify empty and irrelevant data and remove it from the dataframe. Don't forget to verify your cleanup!
- Keep an on data types and unique values for your better understanding of the data
- 

- **Note:** The data used is fresh at the time of publication, therefore trends might change in future. For that, it is recommended to use the fresh data for this project. Recommendations and pull requests are welcome!
